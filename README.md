# Surfs-Up Analysis 
## Overview
###### The main purpose of the analysis is to help W. Avy decide if the weather temperatures would be sustainable to keep an ice cream shop open all year round.  W. Avy had asked us to find the temperatures for specifically June and December. 
## Results 
###### After careful analysis of the project a few conclusions could be made. 
###### The first conclusion is that both the month of December and June had relatively similar temperature averages. The average temperature for June is about 75 degrees, and the average temperature for December is about 71 degrees.

###### The second conclusion is both of the months each have roughly the same temperatures throughout the month. ![december temps](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114840416/210270894-87005d85-4ebc-4b92-90be-d914b65b559f.PNG)

###### The third conclusion is there arent any signifcant increase in low temperatures. They all stayed roughly in the 70s in both months with a few outliers. 
## Summary 
###### With the data provided there isnt a month that is skewed in any specific way. I would conclude that W. Avy would be able to keep his ice cream shop open for 12 months. However, I feel as though temperature wouldnt be the only factor that would close the shop. Earlier in the analysis we had found the precipitation levels for the whole year. I think we should have also included that data in this analysis because rain would definitely be an important factor to keep the shop open or close the shop down. I also think that W. Avy should look at more months than just two. I think a quarterly weather and precipitation analysis would give him a better look at the conditions for his shop.
